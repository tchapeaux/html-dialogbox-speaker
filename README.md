# Dialog animation

Base code + placeholder resources

This was the basis for a quirky secret santa gift.

# What is this

Click anywhere on the page to make the character speak.

# How to use

- Replace the placeholder talking frames with your animation and link them in the CSS
- Write quotes in the `main.js` (a quote is selected randomly at each click)
- Replace the `placeholder_speak.wav` by your custom sound, or use an API key from http://www.voicerss.org/
